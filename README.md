### Project 1: Basic Table Creation
**File:** `SQL_PROJECT_1.sql`

This project focuses on creating basic tables with various data types, including setting primary keys and defining simple structures.

Key concepts:
- Creating tables with different data types
- Setting a primary key
- Basic table structure

### Project 2: Data Insertion
**File:** `SQL_PROJECT_2.sql`

This project demonstrates how to insert data into the previously created tables. It also includes inserting data selectively into specific columns.

Key concepts:
- Inserting data into tables
- Inserting data into specific columns
- Using default values for unspecified columns

### Project 3: Constraints
**File:** `SQL_PROJECT_3 (CONSTRAINTS).sql`

This project covers the use of constraints in SQL, such as `NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`, `PRIMARY KEY`, and `FOREIGN KEY`.

Key concepts:
- Applying constraints to table columns
- Ensuring data integrity with `PRIMARY KEY` and `UNIQUE`
- Foreign key relationships between tables

### Project 4: Updating and Deleting Records
**File:** `SQL_PROJECT_4 (UPDATING AND DELETING).sql`

This project explains how to modify existing data in tables and how to delete specific records based on certain conditions.

Key concepts:
- Using the `UPDATE` statement to modify records
- Applying the `DELETE` statement to remove records
- Using conditions with `WHERE` to target specific records

### Project 5: Queries
**File:** `SQL_PROJECT_5 (QUERIES).sql`

This project demonstrates writing basic to advanced SQL queries, including filtering data, ordering results, and using aggregate functions.

Key concepts:
- Writing `SELECT` statements
- Filtering data using `WHERE`
- Ordering results using `ORDER BY`
- Limiting results with `LIMIT`
- Using `IN` and `OR` for multiple conditions
